# pomodoro_timer

This project exists because I've been needing a simple Pomodoro timer, and this need coincides with my need to simplify and refocus my portfolio.

Initial Features
----------------

- Pomodoro timer, running in 25 minute intervals

- Five minute break timer

- Option to alter the transparency of the window, and allow the timer to rest up in the corner of a screen 


Desired Features
----------------

- Give the user options for setting their own Pomodoro time

- Give the user the option to upload their own timer's "done" sound

- Allow the collapsed timer window to still display the countdown

- Add text editor to enter tasks to be timed/completed
